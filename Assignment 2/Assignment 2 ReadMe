Design Notes 

Part 1: 
	1.	New package
	2.	Import Scanner
	3.	Create a public class named PersonalData for a person with the following instance variables
      ⁃	name: private string
      ⁃	address: private string
      ⁃	age: private integer
      ⁃	phone number: private integer 
      ⁃	create the getters and setters
      ⁃	create a default constructor as well as the overloaded constructor
      ⁃	create a print method in the class which can be invoked in the driver for each object
	4.	Create a Driver class (holds the main method)
      ⁃	use scanner for input
      ⁃	use methods to read values from scanner
	5.	3 instances of a class
      ⁃	Person 1, Person 2, Person 3

Extraneous Comments:

The main method is in the driver class, so the Driver1 class must be run. 
 I used scanner.nextLine()in between certain prompts for data from the user because Scanner was unable to detect whether or not I inputted the data for the phone number field. 

Part 2:
	1.	New package
	2.	Import Random
	3.	Create a class called coin
      ⁃	instance variable sideUp—string 
      ⁃	headsCount—int to keep track
      ⁃	tailsCount —int to keep track
      ⁃	methods:
      ⁃	Coin—default constructor/ no-arg constructor which randomly determines the side of the coin
      ⁃	use if-else statements for heads and tails
      ⁃	seed is 2 for random
      ⁃	toss—heads or tails, sets sideUp accordingly
      ⁃	same logic as Coin()
      ⁃	prints out the value of the toss (i.e Heads or Tails)
      ⁃	checkToss—sees how many heads or tails
      ⁃	use if-else statements
      ⁃	use getSideUp.equal for the string
      ⁃	generate getters and setters
      ⁃	getSideUp which returns value of sideUp field
	4.	 Create a class called Simulation
      ⁃	default constructor Simulation()
      ⁃	method called simulationToss 
      ⁃	takes in a Coin
      ⁃	uses for loop to loop 20 times 	
      ⁃	uses toss from Coin class 
      ⁃	uses checkToss from Coin class to see how many Heads and how many Tails
      ⁃	prints out total value of Heads and Tails in the end using getters from Coin class
	5.	Create Driver2
      ⁃	in Driver2, create a new coin objects called quarter, dime, and nickel
      ⁃	create a new simulation object called s1
      ⁃	use the simulationToss method from Simulation class and pass each type of coin into the parameters respectively 
      ⁃	meaning 1 simulationToss for quarter, one for dime, one for nickel

Extraneous Comments:

The main method is in the driver class, so the Driver2 class must be run. I created a different package in the same project folder (Assignment 2) in order to distinguish between the two parts of the assignment. Since Part 1 required a separate driver and a separate class, I separated the entire code(s) required for the assignment into a separate package.
